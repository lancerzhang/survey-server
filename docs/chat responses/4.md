To add a lottery function to the survey tool, you can create two additional tables: one for storing the prize information and another for tracking the prize winners. Here's a suggested schema for these tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE prizes (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    survey_id INT NOT NULL,
    prize_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    prize_description TEXT,
    total_quantity INT NOT NULL,
    remaining_quantity INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (survey_id) REFERENCES surveys(id)
);

CREATE TABLE winners (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    survey_id INT NOT NULL,
    prize_id INT NOT NULL,
    won_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (survey_id) REFERENCES surveys(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (prize_id) REFERENCES prizes(id)
);
```

These tables include:

- `prizes`: Stores information about the prizes available for each survey, including the prize name, description, total quantity, and remaining quantity.
- `winners`: Tracks the prize winners, linking the user, survey, and prize IDs, as well as the timestamp when the prize was won.

You may need to modify this schema to meet your specific requirements or to adapt it for other database systems.
