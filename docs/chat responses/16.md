To differentiate between anonymous and non-anonymous users, you can add a new field `anonymous` to the `User` model. I'll show you how to update the data schema, data entity, and request/response beans.

1. Update the data schema:

In your `User` table, add a new field `anonymous`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    anonymous BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    -- the rest of the fields
);
```

2. Update the data entity:

Add the `anonymous` field to the `User` entity:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "user")
@Getter
@Setter
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String username;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String email;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private boolean anonymous;

    // the rest of the fields
}
```

3. Update the request and response beans:

You will need to update the request and response beans related to `User` operations to include the `anonymous` field. For example, if you have a `UserRequest` and `UserResponse` class, update them like this:

UserRequest.java:
```java
@Getter
@Setter
public class UserRequest {

    private String username;
    private String email;
    private boolean anonymous;

    // the rest of the fields
}
```

UserResponse.java:
```java
@Getter
@Setter
public class UserResponse {

    private Integer id;
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private boolean anonymous;

    // the rest of the fields
}
```

After making these changes, you will be able to handle anonymous and non-anonymous users in your application. Remember to adjust your service and controller methods accordingly to take the new `anonymous` field into account.
