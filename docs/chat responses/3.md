Here is the updated `surveys` table with the additional fields you requested:

```sql
CREATE TABLE surveys (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    allow_anonymous_response BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    allow_resubmit BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    last_modified TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    end_time TIMESTAMP,
    max_responses INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

These fields have been added to the `surveys` table:

1. `allow_anonymous_response`: A boolean flag indicating whether the survey allows anonymous responses.
2. `allow_resubmit`: A boolean flag indicating whether the survey allows users to resubmit their responses.
3. `is_deleted`: A boolean flag indicating whether the survey has been deleted.
4. `last_modified`: A timestamp indicating the last time the survey was modified.
5. `start_time`: A timestamp indicating when users can start responding to the survey.
6. `end_time`: A timestamp indicating when users can no longer respond to the survey.
7. `max_responses`: An integer indicating the maximum number of responses allowed for the survey. The survey will be closed when this number is reached.

Feel free to modify this schema to fit your specific requirements or to adapt it for other database systems.
